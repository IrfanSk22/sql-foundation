/*

-- UNION and UNION ALL are used to combine result sets from multiple SELECT statements. 
-- The key difference is that UNION removes duplicate rows, while UNION ALL includes all rows, 
even if they are duplicates. 
-- Use UNION when you want distinct values, and use UNION ALL when duplicates are acceptable 
or when you want to optimize performance.
