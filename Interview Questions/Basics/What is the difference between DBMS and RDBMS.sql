/*

Normalization in SQL is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency,
resulting in an efficient and well-structured relational database schema. The primary goals of normalization
are to eliminate data anomalies, improve data integrity, and facilitate efficient data retrieval.
