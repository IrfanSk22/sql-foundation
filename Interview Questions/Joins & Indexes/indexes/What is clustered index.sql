/*

❖ A clustered index is a type of index that 
determines the "physical order" of data in a 
table.

❖ Table data can be sorted in only way, 
therefore, there can be only one
clustered index per table.

❖ In SQL Server, if you set a primary key on a 
column, then it will automatically create a 
clustered index on that particular column
